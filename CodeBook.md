<h1>GetDataProject</h1>

<p>This repo includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a run_analysis.R file, which should be able to generate a tidy dataset</li>
<li>a code book, which explains the data columns of the file</li>
<li>a README file, which you are reading right now</li>
</ul>

<p>The R code should work as long as the UCI HAR Dataset folder is IN your working
directory</p>
